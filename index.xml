      <description>I am a brazilian developer and entrepreneur. I dropped out of the Computer Science course at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo to work on my company, but I missed studying mathematics, so I came back.
These days I am interested in machine learning, continuous optimization and applications of CS and math to other sciences.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Isometric Projection Formula</title>

      <description>This post was inspired by some discussion on this cool 2008 article by Joaquín M. López Muñoz. Having just recently watched Gilbert Strang&amp;rsquo;s OCW Linear Algebra course, I could not resist trying to prove the projection formula in Joaquín&amp;rsquo;s article.
Definition of the problem If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what an isometric projection is, please check the Wikipedia article for a nice introduction. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll try to define it in terms of vectors.</description>
